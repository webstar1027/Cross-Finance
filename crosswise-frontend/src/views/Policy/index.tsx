        This Privacy Policy applies to all Crosswise DEX and Crosswise Labs platforms, websites, and departments. If you
        follow a link to any of Crosswise DEX&apos;s sub-platforms, you must agree to and abide by their unique and
        independent privacy rules. If a sub-privacy platform&apos;s policy contradicts with this Privacy Policy, the
        privacy policy of that sub-platform takes precedence.
